# NantCom's Multi Streamer
A Small application which manage open source tools to allow streaming from OBS to Facebook Live, Twitch and YouTube at the same time!

It was inspired by this guide on OBS:https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/how-to-set-up-your-own-private-rtmp-server-using-nginx.50/. However, after I have fiddled with lots of stuffs for a few days, everything start to magically working but it requires lots of button clicks and configuration files. To remove this technological barrier, I decided to create this app so every streamer can benefit from my newly gained 'art of streaming' skill. ;)

This app is made possible by LEVEL51 (full disclosure: I'm the owner of this company, and this company pay my bills! ~ so it is technically my sponsor :D). 

LEVEL51 builds premium custom gaming laptop and PC and is available in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and soon Nepal.
